This project is the frontend implementation of a hospital website, designed to provide a user-friendly and accessible interface for patients, healthcare professionals, and visitors. The frontend focuses on delivering a clean and professional design, with key features such as:

Responsive Layout: Ensures optimal viewing across all devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
Intuitive Navigation: Simple and easy-to-use navigation to help users quickly find important information, such as services, doctor profiles, and contact details.
Visual Design: A calming color palette with high-quality images and clear typography to create a welcoming online environment.
The frontend is built using modern web technologies, optimized for performance, and designed to seamlessly integrate with backend systems for features like appointment scheduling and patient portals.

Adding a perfect backend of any language will make it a complete website which can be hosted.
